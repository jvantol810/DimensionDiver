# DimensionDiver
# The theme: Parallel Dimensions, I started to make a game where the player dons a scuba diving suit, and dives into parallel worlds.
# The controls: WASD or arrow keys for movement, Spacebar to jump, Holding F enables the player to automatically shoot projectiles forwards.
# How to start: With my progress, heading to the right of Dimension 0, and hopping into the lake will change to a test scene
# 
 # Since the goal of this game jam is to let us swap projects, I wanted to come up with a design that would allow others to add onto it with ease
 # Many of the scripts I developed have public variables that can be changed to suit each level's needs
 # The gameplay is still lacking. If I had more time to work on it myself, here is how I would go about it:
 # the player dives into the lake, and explores the new dimension, looking for collectibles to take back with them, and avoiding any hazards they come across
 # When the oxygen meter runs out, the player should leave automatically (maybe get pulled via a tether?)
 # If the player's HP runs out, then they should leave but drop all of their collectibles
 # The game can progress linearly or randomly, but the lake should have an NPC or shop that lets them get upgrades or advancements
 # Feel free to deviate from this!
# 
# If you are having trouble working with or understanding my code, please reach out to me!
